        </h5>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            1.1 Our NFTs. NFTs that we provide:<br/>

            may, where expressly stated in the description of such NFTs, include additional functionality, content, or
            subscription access to goods, services and/or experiences;
            may be unique or part of a limited series, or redeemable only once;
            may include the ability to redeem an electronic certificate for goods, services and experiences, which may
            be unique or part of a limited series, or redeemable only for a specified number or amount of goods,
            services and experiences;
            may be subject to additional terms or qualifications as stated in the description of the NFT; and
            are subject to applicable laws as in effect from time to time.

        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            1.2 Ownership of NFTs<br/>

            “Own” means your rights with respect to an NFT you have purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from a
            legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the applicable blockchain. You agree, in
            relation to any NFT that you Own, that you Own that NFT in accordance with any description which accompanies
            that NFT. Issuer may, at its option, use third party platforms or wallet extensions (which may be owned or
            operated by third parties) to sell NFTs (“Third Party Sites”). You agree to adhere to any applicable terms
            of service or privacy policies applicable to the use of any Third Party Sites.


            UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICABLE NFT, AN NFT THAT YOU OWN WILL BE TRANSFERABLE,
            BUT ANY TRANSFEREE WILL BE SUBJECT TO THESE NFT TERMS. NFTS THAT WE PROVIDE ARE UTILITY TOKENS TIED TO
            UNIQUE GOODS, SERVICES AND EXPERIENCES. YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE OUR NFTS WITH A VIEW TO INVESTMENT, RESALE
            OR SPECULATION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THEIR PRESENT OR FUTURE VALUE, TRANSFERABILITY OR
            MARKETABILITY.
        </p>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            1.3 Ownership of Creative Materials.<br/>

            You acknowledge and agree that Issuer (or, as applicable, its licensors) own all rights, title and interest
            in and to any artwork, designs, drawings, photographs, labels, logos, beats, trademarks, trade dress,
            copyright, songs, formulas and other creative materials that may be associated with any NFT that you Own
            (collectively, “Creative Materials”), and all intellectual property rights therein. The rights that you have
            in and to the Creative Materials are limited to those expressly stated below, under “Intellectual Property
            Ownership, Licenses and Restrictions.” Notwithstanding any purchase of NFTs, all right, title, and interest
            in the Issuer Intellectual Property (as defined below), including the Creative Materials and other Issuer
            Intellectual Property incorporated in any NFTs (including NFTs that you Own) and including all copyrights,
            trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein, are held by Issuer or its licensors, and you
            agree not to infringe, violate or misappropriate those exclusive rights.

        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            1.4 Risks of NFTs.<br/>

            Once you Own any NFT, you are responsible for any loss or damage to, or loss of access to, the NFT and
            neither Issuer nor any of its licensors shall have any liability in such circumstances, regardless of cause.
            You expressly understand and agree that your use of the Platform and any NFTs is at your sole risk and that
            the Platform and NFTs are provided “as is” and “as available.”
        </p>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            1.5 Terms of Sale.<br/>

            All sales of NFTs are final. Once you have made a purchase of an NFT, you should promptly take the necessary
            steps to complete your transaction (e.g., activate or download any content or secure any seed phrase or
            corresponding private key). We encourage the use of secure, offline storage measures for NFTs. You may
            purchase NFTs using real or virtual/cryptocurrency, where multiple payment options are made available to
            you. You may resell or otherwise transfer an NFT that you Own where this is permitted by these NFT Terms and
            applicable law. Any sale or transfer must provide for the transfer of all of your rights then outstanding
            with respect to such NFT. Anyone receiving such NFTs from you agrees to and is bound by these NFT Terms.
        </p>
        <h5 class="h5">
            2. Limitations on Use
        </h5>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            2.1 Unless explicitly stated, you should assume that all Issuer Intellectual Property is protected by
            copyright, trademark and other applicable intellectual property rights and may not be used except as
            permitted in these NFT Terms. Issuer does not grant, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or
            right to use any Issuer Intellectual Property or NFTs in a manner inconsistent with these NFT Terms without
            the prior written permission of Issuer and/or any third party that may own additional intellectual property.
        </p>
        <h5 class="h5">
            3. Modifications
        </h5>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            3.1 We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the NFTs or the Platform (or any parts of any associated
            software or applications relating thereto) with or without notice at any time; provided, however, that we
            will use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of such action. Issuer (including, without limitation,
            our licensors) shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or
            discontinuance of the NFTs or the Platform or any associated software, applications or functionality.
        </p>
        <h5 class="h5">
            4. TERMINATION
        </h5>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            4.1 We may, in our sole discretion at any time, for any reason or no reason, and without notice or
            liability, immediately terminate your access to all or any part of the Platform and any NFTs. Termination
            may include, but not be limited to (a) removal of your access to, or listing of NFTs on, the Platform, (b)
            the deletion of all account information related to the NFTs from the Platform, and (c) barring any further
            use of or access to the Platform by you.
        </p>
        <h5 class="h5">
            5. ASSUMPTION OF RISK
        </h5>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            You acknowledge that NFTs carry the following risks among others. We expressly disclaim any responsibility
            for these risks.
        </p>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            5.1 Inherent Risks with Digital Assets<br/>

            There are risks associated with using Internet-based digital assets such as NFTs and cryptocurrency,
            including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of
            malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
            information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible
            for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the
            Ethereum blockchain network, however caused.
        </p>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            5.2 Value/Volatility/Not An Investment<br/>

            The prices of NFTs can be extremely volatile and subjective, and NFTs have no inherent or intrinsic value.
            To the extent there is a price or market for a blockchain asset such as an NFT, (a) those prices and markets
            are extremely volatile, (b) variations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely
            affect the value of any digital assets you own, including NFTs, and (c) there is no guarantee that NFTs will
            have or retain any value. NFTs are not securities or financial instruments and are not offered for
            investment purposes. The commercial or market value of NFTs may materially diminish in value as a result of
            a variety of things, including negative publicity associated with Issuer. You accept and acknowledge that we
            will not be responsible for the risks of engaging in any transactions relating to your NFTs with third
            parties (e.g., transferring your NFT from a third party on any so-called “secondary market”).
        </p>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            5.3 Use of Blockchain.<br/>

            The Platform does not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by virtue of the
            ownership record maintained on the Platform’s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum blockchain network. Any
            transfer of NFTs occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Network, and not on the Platform. We do not
            make any promises or guarantees about the availability of NFTs or that it will host your or any other NFTs
            at any specific location and/or for any specific period of time. Upgrades to the Ethereum blockchain, a hard
            fork or other change to the Ethereum blockchain, a failure or cessation of the Ethereum blockchain or its
            underlying cryptocurrency, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain may have
            unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using those or similar technologies, including the NFTs. We
            do not make any promises or guarantees related to the Ethereum Foundation, the Ethereum blockchain, or any
            other third parties related to the NFTs or the Platform (including any of their respective applications
            and/or services, as well as to the continued availability of or the protection or storage of any data you
            provide to those parties). You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any loss of access
            to your NFTs due to loss of your private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, mining attacks,
            hacking, security weaknesses, fraud, counterfeiting, cyberattacks and other technological difficulties.
        </p>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            5.4 Regulatory Uncertainty<br/>

            The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens is uncertain, and new
            regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Platform ecosystem, and
            therefore the potential utility or value of your NFTs. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be
            responsible for the risk of changes to the regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
            cryptocurrencies, and tokens and new regulations, unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more
            jurisdictions or policies any of which may materially adversely affect the use and value of the NFTs.
        </p>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            5.5 Tax Calculations.<br/>

            You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions. We
            are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the Platform or other
            NFT-related transactions.
        </p>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            5.6 General<br/>

            You also acknowledge and agree that: (a) you have obtained sufficient information to make an informed
            decision regarding the NFTs; (b) you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value,
            suitability and appropriateness of these risks for yourself; (c) Issuer does not represent or warrant that
            any NFTs, or its supporting systems or technology, are reliable, current or error-free or otherwise meets
            your requirements, that defects in the NFTs, or their supporting systems or technology, will be corrected,
            or that the delivery mechanism for NFTs will be free of viruses or other harmful components; and (d) Issuer
            shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors or delays you may experience
            related to the NFTs.
        </p>
        <h5 class="h5">
            7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
        </h5>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PLATFORM OR ANY NFTS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
            OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, ISSUER AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PLATFORM AND NFTS “AS IS” WITHOUT
            WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
            MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

            8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
        </h5>
        <p class="has-large-font-size">
            EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY NONWAIVABLE PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, ISSUER (OR ANY
            LICENSOR) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
            INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLATFORM OR ANY
            NFTS OR ELEMENTS THEREOF (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
            LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES), EVEN IF YOU OR OTHER PARTY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
            OF SUCH DAMAGES.
